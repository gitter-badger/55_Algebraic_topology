\begin{document}
The \emph{standard n-ball} is $B^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n | \quad ||x|| \le 1 \}$,
where $||x||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n {x_i}^2 $.
The standard n-ball is also called the \emph{unit n-ball} or the
\emph{n-disk}.

The notation in the literature for the standard n-ball is not uniform.
Sometimes it is denoted by $V^n$ , $D^n$ ,$E^n$ or ${\overline{E}}^n$.

The boundary of the standard n-ball is $S^{n-1}$, the n-1-sphere.

A space that is homeomorphic to the standard n-ball is called
an \emph{n-cell}.

A 1-cell is called an arc and a 2-cell is called a disk.
